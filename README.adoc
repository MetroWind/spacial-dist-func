= Spacial Distribution Function

== Build

- Need http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/[Eigen] installation
- Optional: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2[Catch2] for unit tests.

----
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && make

== Usage

See the `--help` message. I also include a `plot.py` file, as an
example of how you could visualize the distribution result.
